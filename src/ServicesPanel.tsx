    <p>
      I specialize in building full-stack web applications that are interactive, visually engaging, and user-centered.
      With strong skills in both front-end and back-end technologies, I bring ideas to life—whether it’s a playful learning
      tool, a 3D shopping experience, or a custom project for a startup or community. I’m passionate about creating digital
      experiences that not only work well, but also inspire curiosity and connection.
